Given a string s and an integer k, reverse the first k characters for every 2k characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than k characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than 2k but greater than or equal to k characters, then reverse the first k characters and left the other as original.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"


Solution:


s = 'abcdefg'
s = list(s)
print(s)
i = 0
k =2
while i < len(s):
            l = i
            h = (i + k - 1) if (i + k - 1) < len(s) else len(s) - 1
#             print(h)
            while l < len(s) and l < h:
                print(l , h , len(s))
                print(s[l], s[h])
                s[l], s[h] = s[h], s[l]
                l += 1
                h -= 1
            i += (2 * k)
            print(''.join(s))
